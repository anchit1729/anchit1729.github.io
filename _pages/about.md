I am a Computer Science Master's student at the University of Waterloo, working in Human-Computer Interaction under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Schneider](http://oliverschneider.ca). My primary research interests include applying Machine Learning methods in multimodal human-centric contexts, primarily design tools and interfaces. 

Outside of research, I enjoy playing around with Computer Graphics techniques, with a focus on physics-based animation and a bit of physically-based rendering on the side. I also enjoy working with distributed systems and parallel programming. 

My other interests include running, playing video games and watching anime/reading manga.
