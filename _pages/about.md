I am a Computer Science Master's student at the University of Waterloo, working in Human-Computer Interaction under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Schneider](http://oliverschneider.ca). My primary research interests include enabling multimodal interactions in the context of mixed-reality applications. This work often involves the use of techniques from machine learning and computer graphics, alongside empirical research methods common in HCI. 

Outside of research, I enjoy playing around with Computer Graphics techniques, with a focus on physics-based animation and a bit of physically-based rendering on the side. I'm also a big math-head, and like to read up on math research in my free time. Fun fact: I have an Erdos number of 4. 

My other interests include running/lifting, playing video games and watching anime/reading manga.
